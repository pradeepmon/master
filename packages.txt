Packages - collection of files installable [ RPM(.rpm) & YUM ]

RPM [Redhat Packet Manager]
rpm -ivh packagename.version.release.arch.rpm	--> install file
i -> install	|	rpm -q packagename -> queue all the packages
v -> verbose	|	q   -> queue
h -> hashing	|	rpm -qc packagename -> queue the conf. file   
rpm -qd packagename -> queue the doc. file
rpm -e package -> erase/remove
rpm -Uvh packagename.version.release.arch.rpm	--> update file
u -> update

challange with rpm:
1. It will not resolve the dependency
2. package should be in current working directory

==================================================================================

YUM [YellowDog Update Manager]

yum install package
yum info package
yum remove package
yum list all
yum update package

-> yum is a centralised repository (everyone can be accesed)
-> it resolves dependency
-> can be installed anywhere in the n/w
